      <li>Create a document with the color of a midnight sky on a warm summer night.</li>

      <li>Create a round form about the size of a pea that moves repeatedly from the top left corner to the top right corner also moving slightly down.<BR>
        The form should move back and forth at a slow pace, gently easing between each area.</li>

      <li>Create another round form like the first, moving from just left and below the center of the screen to the top right, but below the first form.</li>

      <li>Create another round form by flipping a coin. If heads: moving from top to bottom. If tails: moving from bottom to top.<BR>
        Flip the coin again, if heads have the form move from left to right, tails right to left.</li>

      <li>Repeat the last step two more times.</li>

      <li>Each form should slowly glow an amber-yellow and then dim to being nearly invisible. No two forms should start glowing at the same time.</li>

      <li>Each form should be slightly blurry, as if out of focus.</li>
