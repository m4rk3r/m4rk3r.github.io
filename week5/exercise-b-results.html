            <li>Collect content for the site.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>What were the last 3 songs you listened to? (If you haven't listened to music lately find an object around you and choose 3 songs based on the first, middle, and last letter of the name of the object.)</li>
              <li>Write down the titles and artists of the songs.</li>
              <li>Download the album/song cover for each one.</li>
              <li>Find each song on YouTube and keep the links to each video ready for later.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>The elements in your site will be formatted and displayed using a grid system.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The grid is composed of 3 columns and 3 rows.</li>
              <li>All columns of the grid should be the same width, with a bit of a gap in between each column.</li>
              <li>The height of each cell on the first row should be equal to the width of each column. This means that the 3 cells on the first row are squares.</li>
              <li>The height of each cell on the second row should be half the height of the first row.</li>
              <li>the height of the last row should be a fourth of the first row.</li>
              <li>To add content to the grid, add elements onto the HTML file in the order listed below.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Add your 3 album/song covers onto the page.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure that each image fills up the grid cell it was placed in.</li>
              <li>If the grid was set up correctly, you should have 3 square images on the page lined up in a row.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Write down the song title and artist.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Format the title such that it has more emphasis than the artist's name.</li>
              <li>Use a serif typeface for the song title, and a sans serif typeface for the artist's name.</li>
              <li>Make sure that the artist's name is placed below the song title.</li>
              <li>Align the text to the center of the grid cell.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>On the last row of the grid, create 3 play buttons</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You can use an image if you want, or you can create the shape yourself using CSS. You can also style the buttons however way you want.</li>
              <li>Link each button to the YouTube video that corresponds to each of your songs.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Create a bar thatâ€™s 1/6 the height of the screen and takes up 5/6 of the width, put it all the way to the right and lift it 1/6 screen height from the bottom.</li>
            <li>Create a 1/6 screen width brick on top of the bar, move it to the middle of the bar and place the brick 1/6 screen height above the bar.</li>
            <li>Make sure both the bar and the brick are the color of white and when hovered, they turn crimson, ease-in-outly.</li>
            <li>Now put a 30x30px, sky blue ball bouncing in between the bar and the brick every 0.5 seconds. When shown on a mobile size screen, the color of the background turns lavender and the ball turns yellow.</li>

            <li>create a document with the two side of the walls of the well in the middle of the canvas. The well is as tall as the the whole canvas.</li>

            <li>[Inside the two lines of wall:]<BR>
            create a circle with skin color in the middle of two orange lines and create two dark ellipses lay separately on the middle of the circle. Make sure thewy are place in the lower part of the screen.</li>

            <li>create an orange rectangle and put it on the circle under the two ellipses</li>

            <li>let the rectangle's height change slightly all the time just like open and close</li>

            <li>create two skin colored circles on each side of the first one make the one on left in an arc route arounded the circle to the top of the larger circle and then go back on the same route. Make the one on right move the same route but move right.</li>

            <li>put two pinky orange rectangles under the first skin color circle. The top part of two rectangles should be covered by the circle. Make sure the rectangles touch the buttom of the screen.</li>

            <li>create a red circle with a black line under it and place it to the top, outside the screen</li>

            <li>[Outside the two lines of wall:]<br>
            create a large rectangle or button outside the well, write something to let people want to click</li>

            <li>[Inside the two lines of wall:]<br>
            Once the cursor touch the button, the red circle with line will gradually go down straightly and appear on the screen, but it can only reach the middle of the screen and cannot reach to those skin colored circles at the bottom</li>

            <li>[Outside the two lines of wall:]<br>
            create another large rectangle or button outside the well on the opposite side, write something to let people want to click</li>

            <li>[Inside the two lines of wall:]<br>
            Once the cursor touch the second button, there will be a layer of transparent rectangle covered the place inside the wall, gradually move from the buttom to the top.</li>
