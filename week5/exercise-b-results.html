            <ul>
              <li>What were the last 3 songs you listened to? (If you haven't listened to music lately find an object around you and choose 3 songs based on the first, middle, and last letter of the name of the object.)</li>
              <li>Write down the titles and artists of the songs.</li>
              <li>Download the album/song cover for each one.</li>
              <li>Find each song on YouTube and keep the links to each video ready for later.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>The elements in your site will be formatted and displayed using a grid system.</li>

              <li>The grid is composed of 3 columns and 3 rows.</li>
              <li>All columns of the grid should be the same width, with a bit of a gap in between each column.</li>
              <li>The height of each cell on the first row should be equal to the width of each column. This means that the 3 cells on the first row are squares.</li>
              <li>The height of each cell on the second row should be half the height of the first row.</li>
              <li>the height of the last row should be a fourth of the first row.</li>
              <li>To add content to the grid, add elements onto the HTML file in the order listed below.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Add your 3 album/song covers onto the page.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure that each image fills up the grid cell it was placed in.</li>
              <li>If the grid was set up correctly, you should have 3 square images on the page lined up in a row.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Write down the song title and artist.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Format the title such that it has more emphasis than the artist's name.</li>
              <li>Use a serif typeface for the song title, and a sans serif typeface for the artist's name.</li>
              <li>Make sure that the artist's name is placed below the song title.</li>
              <li>Align the text to the center of the grid cell.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>On the last row of the grid, create 3 play buttons</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You can use an image if you want, or you can create the shape yourself using CSS. You can also style the buttons however way you want.</li>
              <li>Link each button to the YouTube video that corresponds to each of your songs.</li>

            <li>First create a background color you like</li>

            <li>Second, name your division class, and don't forget the hr tag, which could separate the content or define the change.</li>

            <li>Third, in your css file, set up the position and transform under the name of your division class. Reposition your objects using transform: translate, also set up the width and height for your objects.</li>

            <li>Fourth, remenbered we created the hr code in your html file? using that to define the changes of your object under the name of your devision class in the css file. In here, you can set up the boarder radius, and the animation for spin the objects. in order to make the circles keep moving, set up the ease infinite behind animation spin.</li>

            <li>fifth, now create the four child objects and set up the color and animation delay for all of them.</li>

            <li>sixth, set up the animation style under the keyframe spin tag. set up the percentage for each of the moving elements. For example, the first element should have two percentage, 0% and 100%, and inside the {} there should have translate percentage. Increase the percentage 25% started from the 0% for each objects. So the second element should be 25%{transform:translate(160%)}. The 160% behind the translate means the space between four moving objects, it could varies depends on the space you want. One thing really important is the third child, 50%{transform:translate(160%,160%)}, there are two 160%. and for the forth child 75%{transform:translate(0,160%)} is necessary, in order to make the objects moving in order. Test the percentage out.</li>

            <li>Use the saved image to make the background of your webpage.</li>
            <li>Create a black tint for the background by creating an element that

            <li>Create an animation that changes the background color from
            0% opacity to white and 80% opacity, then back to 0% opacity.</li>
            <li>Create a class for an element that starts with no background color,
            is about the size of a medium-sized star (in comparison to the background
            image), circular, and has a little blur around the edges. Set its
            attributes so that you can position it using absolute values (as
            opposed to relative). Make sure that the size of the element is responsive.</li>
            <li>Set the animation of the class to use the animation that you created.

          <h4>Instructions: Eye Spy in Your Camera Roll</h4>
          <p>In order to create this page, you need to go way back in your phone history–– seriously, we’re talking those first photos, because this is a game of eye spy.</p>
          <p>Based on your preference below, you will find 40 photos in your camera roll in accordance to the colors you’ve been assigned, 80 total, 40 per color. The color needs to be the most prominent in the image (it’s okay if not the entire image)/</p>
          	<h5>Which do you prefer:</h5>
            <ul>
            		<li>🐶 corgis: 	Red –– Green</li>
            		<li>🐨 koalas:	Orange –– Blue</li>
            		<li>😸 cats:		Yellow –– Purple</li>
            </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Great. You will now find photos on your phone/computer in the first color of the two. If you don’t have enough photos, congratulations–– you’re going on an adventure. See the “Shit, A Color Adventure” section below for further instruction now.</li>
            <li>Once you found 40 photos of your first color, airdrop/email/send them to your computer. You will put these into a new folder titled the name of your color (eg. “red”). </li>
            <li>Name the photos based on their hue of your first color, ordering from lightest to darkest and rename the file accordingly.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process listed above for the second color you were assigned based on your animal preference, making sure to add a subtle differentiation in numbers to prevent calling the wrong image on the browser.</li>
            <li>In looking at your folder, make sure the images are at a low resolution so the screen will be able to process them in a timely manner. </li>
            <li>Crop images are so they are in a portrait orientation</li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h5>Let’s set this shit up!</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Currently, you should have two folders on your desktop, named a particular color, with 40 photos inside. You will create a new folder titled “exercise-b-eye-spy-“ with your name following the “spy-“ (eg. “spy-bob”).</li>
            <li>Move your two photo folders titled with your two assigned colors inside of the “exercise-b-eye-spy-*name*) folder you just made.</li>
            <li>Open up a code editor of your choice and create two documents, one of basic web language, and one assisting said page on design preferences.</li>
            <li>Set up your “basic web language” doc and save this into your exercise b folder. Do the same for your “assisted design page”, making sure the two link.</li>

          <h5>Great! Let’s get going on this layout.</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Title your document + make the web page responsive/compatible for screen readers, emojis, etc</li>
            <li>Make sure you’re text is responsive should an increased screen view be used.</li>
            <li>Create an all-encompassing container that holds the components of an organizational layout that is divisible by 40 across and down the screen (hint, these will be different numbers).</li>
            <li>One photo will be uploaded per unit. Sort the interior works within said container to make sure that the layout is an entire entity and responsive.</li>
            <li>Depending on the height of your desired cells, please make sure to put these dimensions to your photos as well, so they take up the entire width of a unit.</li>
            <li>Should one cursor move over the top of one image cell, please code and alternative image to appear, of the compliment color, that is also arranged from lightest to darkest. Thus, as one moves over all of the images on the page in order, they will be revealed to see an accompanying image in a similar light-dark hue of the complementary color in the same place as the original colored photo.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process above for every image on the screen (hint - you should just copy and paste! Doing so with your file names up for photos makes this process a whole lot faster!) *There should be no white space between the cell’s units and all components within the container should be touching. Should this be a problem, please consult your assisted design page to ensure that said proportions of cells containing images are congruent with the cell’s determined dimensions.</li>
            <li>Add a component to the page in a web-safe, sans-serif typeface that says “eye spy *name’s* camera roll (eg. “Eye spy bob’s camera roll”)</li>
            <li>Give your container some room to breathe on the page, so that it is not lying right against your scroll bar ;)</li>
            <li>Alter the icon representing how one navigates the page to resemble something that is “searching” or “looking for”</li>
            <li>Make the webpage responsive at different screen sizes so no photos are cut off and we can see your lovely images</li>
            <li>Cheer–– you’re done! Save this bad boy and upload it to github!</li>

            <li>Create a document that contains a 3 by 3 grid with a thin, black border around the grid. Every space in the grid should have the same value of height and width, and the height should equal to width</li>
            <li>Put the poem shown below in the top left square which should be set to a green background. The poem should use the font courier, align to the left, bold the title, should be scrolled to view the part at the bottom, and do not let it go over the square.</li>
            <li>Create a pink background for the square in the middle (column2, row 2). Put a red ball (round form) about the size of a pea that bounces up (50% out of the square) in the middle of the pink square. The ball should start from the middle, and then moves up, and then moves below the start point a tiny bit, and repeat infinitely. </li>
            <li>Put the image below in the bottom right square with pink background. The width of the image should be the width of the square. As the poem you put in the first square, this image should be set to its original ratio so it should be able to scroll down in the square. </li>

            <p>Poem: The Answer Baseness is a passport for the base, Honour an epitaph for the honourable. See how the gilded sky teems With the twisted shadows of the dead. The ice age is over, So why does ice still bind the world? The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered, So why is the Dead Sea still thick with sails? I come into this world Carrying only paper, rope and a shadow, To proclaim before judgment is passed This plea of the judged: Listen to me, world, I ! do ! not ! believe! If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet Then I am number one thousand and one. I do not believe the sky is blue; I do not believe the thunder’s roar; I do not believe that dreams are false; I do not believe that death has no revenge. If the ocean is destined to break the dike; Then let its bitter water pour into my soul; If the land is destined to rise, Then let mankind choose a new mountain for survival. The vast unobstructed firmament Is it with glimmering stars; They are a new turning: These hieroglyphs of the ages, These staring eyes of the future. </p>

            <li>Set the background of this second element a gradient from a teal blue, to a pale blue, to a deep blue.</li>
            <li>In this second element, make a grid that is ten columns by ten rows. The column widths should be variable but use the available space. The rows should also be variable, but start small and get bigger by the last row.</li>
            <li>Create a hundred elements within this grid in order to style each cell.</li>
            <li>Set each of the hundred cells background color to white and add a small margin to give them space.</li>
            <li>Select all the even cells and round their edges slightly so that they look like rounded squares</li>
            <li>Select all the odd cells and do the same, but with a different settings so there is some variability</li>
            <li> Select a handful of the first elements of each row and add margin so that the rows don't all start in the same place</li>
            <li> Execute the last step for a handful of the last element of each row, for the same effect.</li>
