 			<p><b>The Answer</b><br>
Baseness is a passport for the base,<br>
Honour an epitaph for the honourable.<br>
See how the gilded sky teems<br>
With the twisted shadows of the dead.<br>
The ice age is over,<br>
So why does ice still bind the world?<br>
The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered,<br>
So why is the Dead Sea still thick with sails?<br>
I come into this world<br>
Carrying only paper, rope and a shadow,<br>
To proclaim before judgment is passed<br>
This plea of the judged:<br>
Listen to me, world,<br>
I ! do ! not ! believe!<br>
If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet<br>
Then I am number one thousand and one.<br>
I do not believe the sky is blue;<br>
I do not believe the thunderâ€™s roar;<br>
I do not believe that dreams are false;<br>
I do not believe that death has no revenge.<br>
If the ocean is destined to break the dike;<br>
Then let its bitter water pour into my soul;<br>
If the land is destined to rise,<br>
Then let mankind choose a new mountain for survival.<br>
The vast unobstructed firmament<br>
Is it with glimmering stars;<br>
They are a new turning:<br>
These hieroglyphs of the ages,<br>
These staring eyes of the future.</p>
