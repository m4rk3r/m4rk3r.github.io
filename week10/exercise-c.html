    <h1>Exercise C: Variation Machine</h1>
    <p>In this exercise, we will utilize the various <mark>string</mark> and <mark>array</mark> tools we've learned about to create three dynamic variations on a sentence.</p>

    <main>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>To begin, let's step back from code and think about how variations can be formed. Read an excerpt from <em>Exercises in Style</em> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo" target="_blank">Oulipo</a> novelist, poet, and critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Queneau" target="_blank">Raymond Queneau</a>. <a href="queneau-exercisesinstyle.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Link.</a></li>
        <li>
          Next, download the <a href="exercise-c.tar.gz" target="_blank">exercise template</a> and add it to your project folder that we've kept in sync with github.
        </li>
        <li>
            Look at the <mark>index.js</mark> file for the three variation javascript functions. Preform your work within those functions on the <mark>newSentence</mark> variable that is outputted to the page. See the <mark>variationExample</mark> function for a guide on how to get started.

            A few ideas to get you thinking:
            <ul class="two-column">
              <li>Swap the gender of third person pronouns with <mark>replace()</mark>.</li>
              <li>Change letter case, punctuation, or order of words.. <mark>toUpperCase()</mark>, <mark>toLowerCase()</mark>, and <mark>slice()</mark></li>
              <li>Work with the sentence as an array. Convert to array with <mark>split()</mark> and recombine to a string with <mark>join()</mark></li>
              <li>You <a href="https://m4rk3r.github.io/week8/js-intro-4.html#19" target="_blank">can use objects</a> to create a <mark>key -> value</mark> relationship between words. <a href="../examples/swap-words.js" target="_blank">Here's an example.</a>
              <li>You don't have to limit yourself to the words in the sentence itself. Think about the style of the sentence... bold, italics, and other ways of demarcating text.</li>
            </ul>
            <BR>

        </li>
        <li>
            When you are done, add your project to your github <a href="/week1/cli-git.html">(git slides for refresher)</a> and then email the url
            to <a href="mailto:beasleym@newschool.edu">me (beasleym@newschool.edu)</a>. Submit your variation machine no later than <b>Thursday, April 2nd by 8pm.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Next class we'll try out the variation machines you've created by inputting new sentences and discussing your process.</p>
      <ul class="discussion">
        <li>How will your machine handle new, unexpected input?</li>
        <li>If it breaks or has no effect, did you account for that case?</li>
        <li>Any particular challenges or struggles you encountered?</li>
        <li>To what degree can your variation machine change the meaning of the input sentence?</li>
      </ul>
